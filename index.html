       <p>I am a blogger, and journalism student at the University of Miami. Over the last two years, I have maintained my own news site the South Florida Report, creating and publishing articles and photo essays on a regular basis. My website has garnered more than 18,000 views since it was founded. Having worked a part-time security job, and written for my school paper, I have substantial experience working as part of a team, meeting deadlines, being flexible, and working under pressure.  I like a good challenge, and look forward to the day when I work for a major news organization.</p>
